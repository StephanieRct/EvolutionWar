EvolutionWar
============
This is a simple project I made a long time ago just for fun. There are 2 AIs that control each a character in 2D space. 
Each AI have a list of action to do each round. They do what they can with the number of Action Points they have each round.
When one AI dies, the winner get cloned and mutated into another AI with which he will fight against and the process continue on and on.<br>


instruction:<br>
1-build/run<br>
2-hit Pause (on your keyboard) to see current winner ai code*<br>
3-Eat cake<br>
*Result may change from one run to another.<br>
Use, Copy, Modify, or do whatever you want want with this code. I'm not responsible for anything you do 
with this and it's not my fault if you die by to much cake eating. :)<br>
Also don't mind the ugly code, cheers! &lt;3 <br>
