Genetic Algorithm involving AIs fighting each other to the death... or not?
By Stephanie Rancourt   @StephanieRct
Original version date: somewhen around 2009 and 2010
instruction:
1-run
2-hit Pause (on your keyboard) to see current winner ai code*
3-Eat cake
*Result may change from one run to another.
Use, Copy, Modify, or do whatever you want want with this code. I'm not responsible for anything you do 
with this and it's not my fault if you die by to much cake eating. :)
Also don't mind the ugly code, cheers!
